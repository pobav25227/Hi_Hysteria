##### (2023/06/12) 0.4.8:

```
hysteria update to v1.3.5:
v1.3.5 fixes a socks5 bug in domain name resolution, supports colored characters under windows cmd, and has no important function updates

Q: Hy 1.x version will not have any major function updates?
A: Hysteria 1.x will continue to release bugs and security fixes. Now the focus of development is on hy2. At present, the functions of hy1 are very complete. There is no difference between hy1 and hy2 in terms of speed. The difference is that hy2 pays more attention to traffic and http/3 traffic. It can realize the function of falling back to the web similar to xray, but there is no guarantee that the udp traffic will not be blocked, so it is currently in the testing stage, and the actual effect remains to be seen

Q: When will hihy support hy2?
A: hy2 is currently in the testing state. Many functions of hy1 are not supported by hy2, and the client can only be used with the command line. Wait for hy2 to release the first complete public version before considering adaptation

1. Fix the problem that the correct hysteria version number cannot be obtained because the server ip is too dark
2. matsuri will not release major function updates, and Android users are advised to choose its "upgraded version" nekobox
https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/NekoBoxForAndroid
```


##### (2023/03/15) 0.4.7

```
hysteria update to 1.3.4 : Fixed some bugs, updated dependencies, the client provides the lazy_start option, only connects to the server when incoming data, client functions

1. The client adds lazy_start configuration. Currently, it only supports v2rayN, a client that uses the core to run directly. Others will be added after the subsequent version is packaged.
2. Increase net.core.rmem_max
3. Increase the waiting time for configuration testing by 5 seconds, because there may be a delay in ACME certificate application to prevent configuration detection failures
4. Improve the client introduction document

Tips: It is observed that the operatorâ€™s UDP QoS rules are frequently triggered after lazy_start is turned on. For safety, it is temporarily disabled by default after 0.4.7.a
If you need to test, please manually add the client option `"lazy_start": true`, follow up later
```

##### (2023/02/17) 0.4.6

```
hysteria update to 1.3.3 : fixed some bugs, updated dependencies to improve performance

```

##### (2022/12/04) 0.4.4.m

```
Hysteria 1.3.1 is released, which supports fast_open to speed up the response and improve a little performance (currently fast_open is only applicable to the direct operation mode of the hysteria kernel (V2rayN), and other clients do not directly support it)
1. Support comments on configuration
2. Added reminders for self-signed certificates. Recently, GFW has seriously blocked self-signed certificates and is no longer recommended.
3. Added some prompt information to facilitate the configuration process
4. Add random password function
5. Improve the support for PortHopping, fix the bug that iptables rules disappear after restarting the system

8. Fix the bug that netfilter-persistent rules cannot be deleted
9. Some other bug fixes
10. Support fast_open
11. Add other client downloads on the release to facilitate direct access
12. Fix the bug that lsof does not distinguish between port type and listening status
13. Improve the judgment of port legitimacy and guide users to input the correct port as much as possible
14. Modify the test configuration method to speed up the configuration printing time
15. Fix the way of real-time log printing, use redirection to cat to prevent untimely update

Q: Why is 0.4.4 updated so frequently and with so much content?
A: In the last version, a lot of ancestral codes were moved to be compatible with portHopping, resulting in a bunch of bugs, so there are more fixes
```

##### (2022/11/08) 0.4.3.c

**The original warehouse of hysteria was renamed from [@HyNetwork](https://github.com/HyNetwork/hysteria) to [@apernet](https://github.com/apernet/hysteria), please be lower than 0.4.3. Users of the c version can use it after updating, otherwise the core information cannot be obtained and the installation will fail!!!**

```
1. Hysteria 1.3.0 is released, which supports multi-port monitoring function (only supported by UDP protocol), and can switch without sense to prevent problems such as single-port QoS/disconnection
For details, please refer to: https://github.com/emptysuns/Hi_Hysteria/blob/main/md/portHopping.md
2. Fix the remaining bugs when switching protocols in the previous version
3. Modify some text colors to make the printed results clearer
4. After clash.meta 1.13.2, the alpn configuration becomes an array. If your version is lower than 1.13.2, you may need to update your client to support the latest configuration
Details: https://docs.metacubex.one/function/proxy/hysteria
5. Fix the bug that the protocol type is misjudged when port hopping is started
```

#### (2022/10/28) 0.4.2:

```
Note: hysteria 1.2.2 adds heartbeat detection configuration, if v2rayN wants to use the latest hihy configuration, please update hysteria to 1.2.2 or above, otherwise it will not be compatible with the latest configuration

1. The menu provides the function of viewing logs
2. Fix the bug that the print result is not synchronized after modifying the protocol type
3. Added heartbeat detection configuration
    Tip: It is only applicable to v2rayN, which runs directly through the hysteria kernel
         Clash-Meta/passwall is not adapted, nekoray needs to be added manually, one-click link does not support import
4. Reduce the increased bandwidth redundancy and prevent the redundancy increment from being too high when the bandwidth is too large
5. Modify the restart service interval to one week
```

#### (2022/09/10) 0.4.1:

```
Notice: Please use wechat-video and users whose hysteria Core version is lower than 1.2.1 update the dual-end
Because hysteria 1.2.1 fixed the bug that caused wechat-video to fail if obfs was not enabled, if it is not updated
will result in a failure to connect

1. Reduce the waiting time when configuring detection, and increase the time waiting for the detection process to close
2. Add FAQ
```

#### (2022/08/14) 0.4.0

2. Modify the generation source of acl rules, convert long-term maintenance and update clash shunt rules into hysteria acl rules, and repair 0.3.8.1 acl shielding rules
3. The hysteria milestone is updated to 1.1.0, the cpu overhead is reduced, and the speed is increased by at least 130%-500%. Chuan strongly recommends updating both ends
4. Modify the print style of the result to be more clearly visible
```

#### (2022/06/26) 0.3.8

```

1. Add i686 architecture adaptation
2. Add the detection that port 443 80 is occupied by other processes and cannot apply for a certificate, prompt information and give the option to stop the process

4. bug fixed
5. Provide clash-meta support (cuckoo)
```

#### (2022/05/14) 0.3.7

```
